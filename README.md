# Keybase-Username-to-Email
This is a PHP script that be used to pull the emails out of a PGP key, the current script is set up to be used on keybase but this will work for MANY deferent services that use PGP's. 

Usage (in url assuming on a webserver): 
https://host/KeybaseUsernameToEmail.php?username=NAMEGOESHERE

Note, it is possible to pull out the Name used to register as well I just found it tough to get consistent results when trying to filter for the name space. I'm probably missing something easy lol.
